    "## Reinforcement Learning(RL)\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take decisions by performing actions in  an environment to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terms:\n",
    "1. **Agent:** The learner or decision maker.\n",
    "2. **Environment:** The external systems with which the agent interacts.\n",
    "3. **State`(s)`:** A reprentation of the current situation of the agent.\n",
    "4. **Action`(a)`:** A set of all possible moves the agent can take.\n",
    "5. **Action Space:** The set of all valid actions in a given environment is often called `Action Space`.\n",
    "   1. ***Descrete Action Space:*** where only a finite number of moves are available for agents. EX. `Atari and GO`\n",
    "   2. ***Continuous Action Space:*** In continous action space actions are real-valued matrix- ex. `Robot`. \n",
    "6. **Reward`(r)`:** Feedback from the environment based on the action taken by agent. $r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) \\text{ or } r_t = R(s_t), \\text{ or state-action pair } r_t = R(s_t,a_t).$\n",
    "7. **Return:** `Finite Horizontal undiscounted return` $\\to R(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^T r_t.$ `Infinite Horizontal discounted return` $$\\to \\gamma \\in (0,1): R(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r_t.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Value Function`(V)`:** The expected long-term return with discount, as oppsed to short-term reward.\n",
    "9.  **Q-Value`(Q)`:** The expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and following a particular policy thereafter. \n",
    "10. **Trajectories($\\tau$):** A trajectory $\\tau$ is a sequence of states and actions in the world. $\\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ...).$\n",
    "`The very first state of the world`, $s_0$, is randomly sampled from the start-state distribution, sometimes denoted by $\\rho_0:s_0 \\sim \\rho_0(\\cdot).$ State transitions are governend by the natural laws of the environment and depend only on the most recent action, $a_t$.\n",
    "    1. Deterministic: $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t)$\n",
    "    2. Stochastic: $s_{t+1} \\sim P(\\cdot|s_t, a_t)$"
