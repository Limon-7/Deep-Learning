    "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.Now when we think of a neural network we think about matrix multiplications but that is not the case with ConvNet. It uses a special technique called Convolution. It is specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing."
