    "Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays of numbers or terms. In geometry, vectors store the magnitude and direction of a potential change to a point. The vector [3, -2] says go right 3 and down 2. A vector with more than one dimension is called a matrix.\n",

    "1. Column Vector: A column vector is an $n\\times 1$ matrix because it always has 1 column and some number of rows. \n",

    "2. Row Vector: A row vector is a $1\\times n$ matrix, as it has 1 row and some number of columns.\n",

    "3. Scalar Operation: Scalar operations involve a vector and a number. You modify the vector in-place by adding, subtracting, or multiplying the number from all the values in the vector. $$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} + 1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 3 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
